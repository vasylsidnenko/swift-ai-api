        "answer": "@State is a property wrapper that allows you to store and modify values within a view. When you navigate to a new view, the @State variables of the previous view are destroyed. When you navigate back, a new instance of the previous view is created, and its @State variables are initialized to their default values. This means @State does not persist data across navigation transitions.",

        "answer": "To persist data across navigation transitions, you should use alternative property wrappers like @EnvironmentObject or @ObservedObject. These allow you to share data between views. For simple data persistence within a single view hierarchy, you can also use @Binding to pass a mutable reference to a @State variable in a parent view.  However, for complex navigation scenarios, a more robust solution might involve using a data model class with @Published properties and observing changes in child views.",

        "answer": "While @State is not designed for data persistence across navigation, you can leverage it in conjunction with other mechanisms like a shared data model or a custom solution using `onAppear` and `onDisappear` to manually save and restore state. For instance, you can store the @State value in a shared `ObservableObject` within `onDisappear` and retrieve it in `onAppear`.  Consider using a dedicated state management solution like Redux or TCA for more complex applications to manage state transitions and data persistence effectively.  This approach allows for a clear separation of concerns and predictable state management.",
