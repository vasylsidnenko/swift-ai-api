Implement a form to input new items, and utilize State and Binding effectively to manage the data flow between the view and the model. Ensure the UI updates appropriately when items are added or removed. Here\u2019s a basic structure to get you started:\n```swift\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var items: [String] = []\n    @State private var newItem: String = \"\"\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            TextField(\"Add new item\", text: $newItem)\n                .padding()\n            Button(\"Add Item\") {\n                if !newItem.isEmpty {\n                    items.append(newItem)\n                    newItem = \"\"\n                }\n            }\n            List {\n                ForEach(items, id: \\ .self) { item in\n                    Text(item)\n                }\n                .onDelete(perform: deleteItem)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func deleteItem(at offsets: IndexSet) {\n        items.remove(atOffsets: offsets)\n    }\n}\n```",

They should be able to create a basic user interface that allows for user input and display items in a list.\n\nTo implement this, students should use the provided code structure as a starting point. They need to understand how to create a `@State` property to hold the list of items and another `@State` property for the new item. The `TextField` and `Button` components will enable the input and addition of new items. The `List` will dynamically update as items are added or removed.\n\nKey components include:\n- `@State` for storing state variables.\n- `TextField` for user input.\n- `Button` for triggering actions.\n- `List` for displaying data and managing items with `onDelete` functionality.",
