          "answer": "Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is a powerful API in Objective-C that allows developers to efficiently manage concurrent tasks. At a basic level, GCD helps in executing tasks asynchronously, which means the main thread remains responsive while other tasks are executed in the background. To fetch data from a URL using GCD, you can create a new dispatch queue and use the `dispatch_async` function to handle the network request. Here\u2019s a simple example:\n\n```objc\nNSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://api.example.com/data\"];\nNSURLSessionDataTask *dataTask = [[NSURLSession sharedSession] dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {\n    if (error) {\n        NSLog(@\"Error fetching data: %@\", error);\n        return;\n    }\n    // Process the data\n    NSLog(@\"Data received: %@\", data);\n}];\n[dataTask resume];\n```\n\nIn this example, the data fetching operation does not block the main thread. Instead, it runs asynchronously, allowing the app to continue running smoothly while waiting for the response. Dispatch queues are crucial for managing these tasks, as they determine the order and execution context of the operations. Using GCD correctly ensures that tasks are executed efficiently without freezing the user interface.",

          "answer": "At the Intermediate level, students should understand how to implement GCD for more complex scenarios, including handling multiple concurrent tasks and using dispatch groups to synchronize tasks. Dispatch groups allow you to aggregate a set of tasks and be notified when they are all complete. Here\u2019s an example of using a dispatch group to fetch multiple URLs:\n\n```objc\ndispatch_group_t group = dispatch_group_create();\nNSArray *urls = @[\n    [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://api.example.com/data1\"],\n    [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://api.example.com/data2\"]\n];\n\nfor (NSURL *url in urls) {\n    dispatch_group_enter(group);\n    NSURLSessionDataTask *dataTask = [[NSURLSession sharedSession] dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {\n        if (error) {\n            NSLog(@\"Error fetching data: %@\", error);\n        } else {\n            NSLog(@\"Data received from %@: %@\", url, data);\n        }\n        dispatch_group_leave(group);\n    }];\n    [dataTask resume];\n}\n\ndispatch_group_notify(group, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n    NSLog(@\"All data fetched.\");\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, multiple data fetch operations are tracked by the dispatch group, and the completion handler runs only after all fetch operations are completed. This approach is useful when you need to aggregate results from several network requests.",

They should be able to evaluate complex implementations, understand performance implications, and apply advanced patterns related to Concurrency in sophisticated Apple applications. For instance, utilizing quality of service (QoS) classes to prioritize certain tasks can significantly improve app responsiveness. Here's an advanced example that fetches data with QoS:\n\n```objc\ndispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED, 0);\ndispatch_async(queue, ^{\n    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://api.example.com/data\"];\n    NSURLSessionDataTask *dataTask = [[NSURLSession sharedSession] dataTaskWithURL:url completionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {\n        if (error) {\n            NSLog(@\"Error: %@\", error);\n            return;\n        }\n        // Process the data\n        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n            // Update UI with data\n        });\n    }];\n    [dataTask resume];\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the task is dispatched to a global queue with user-initiated QoS, indicating that it is a high-priority task. This can help improve user experience by executing time-sensitive tasks efficiently. Additionally, understanding how to properly manage memory and resources in concurrent situations is crucial for optimizing performance.",
